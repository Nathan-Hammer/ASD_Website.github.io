        <h2>How to Check Your Tire Pressure</h2>
        <p>Proper tire pressure is essential for safe driving and optimal fuel efficiency. To check your tire pressure, first find the recommended tire pressure for your vehicle, which can typically be found on a sticker inside the driver's side door jamb or in your vehicle's owner's manual. Then, use a tire pressure gauge to check the pressure in each tire. If the pressure is low, use an air compressor to add air until the pressure reaches the recommended level.</p>

        <h2>Tire Rotation and Alignment</h2>
        <p>Why It Matters: Tires wear unevenly due to factors like driving habits and road conditions. Rotating and aligning your tires ensures even wear and extends their life. How Often: Rotate your tires every 10,000 kilometers, and get an alignment check if you notice uneven tire wear.</p>

        <h2>Fluid Checks and Top-ups</h2>
        <p>Why It Matters: Coolant, brake fluid, power steering fluid, and transmission fluid keep critical systems running smoothly. Low levels can indicate leaks or other issues. How Often: Check fluids monthly and top up as needed. Replace coolant every 50,000 kilometer and brake fluid every 30,000 kilometers.</p>

        <p>Why It Matters: Brakes are crucial for stopping safely. Worn pads or rotors can increase stopping distances and decrease control. How Often: Have your brakes inspected during routine service visits. Replace worn components promptly.</p>
